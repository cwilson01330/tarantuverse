## üîê Privacy & Security

**Public Data:**
- Keeper profiles (username, display_name, avatar, bio, location, experience, specialties, social links)

- Public tarantula details (name, species, photo, sex, date acquired)

**NOT Public:**
- User email addresses
- Passwords (obviously)
- Private tarantulas (visibility = 'private')
- Collections where user chose private visibility
- Full collection if ANY tarantula is private (only public ones show)

**Security Measures:**
- No authentication required (public pages)
- 404 responses for private profiles (don't reveal existence)
- Input validation on filters
- SQL injection protection (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- CORS configured for known origins
- XSS protection (React escaping)

## üìù Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. **No Pagination UI:** Backend supports it, but frontend loads all results (fine for <100 keepers)
2. **No Sorting Options:** Currently ordered by most recently updated only
3. **No Profile Views Counter:** Can't see how many times your profile was viewed
4. **No "Featured" Section:** All keepers shown equally
5. **No Keeper Following:** Can't save favorite keepers yet

### Planned Improvements:
- Add pagination controls when community grows
- Add sort dropdown (newest, most experienced, most tarantulas)
- Track and display profile view counts
- Add "Follow" button (Phase 4)
- Add "Recently Viewed" section
- Show mutual specialties/interests

## üìû Support & Feedback

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Render logs for API errors
2. Check browser console for frontend errors
3. Verify user has `collection_visibility = 'public'`
4. Verify tarantulas have `visibility = 'public'`
5. Test API endpoints directly with curl
6. Check database schema migration completed

**Debugging Tips:**
```sql
-- Check public keepers count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE collection_visibility = 'public';

-- Check public tarantulas for a user
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tarantulas 
WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID AND visibility = 'public';

-- Find keepers with most public tarantulas
SELECT u.username, COUNT(t.id) as tarantula_count 
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN tarantulas t ON u.id = t.user_id AND t.visibility = 'public'
WHERE u.collection_visibility = 'public'
GROUP BY u.username 
ORDER BY tarantula_count DESC;
```
