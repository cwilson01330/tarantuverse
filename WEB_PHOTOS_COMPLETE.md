## 🔧 Technical Details

### URL Handling Logic
```typescript
const getImageUrl = (url?: string) => {
  if (!url) return ''
  // If URL starts with http, it's already absolute (R2)
  if (url.startsWith('http')) {
    return url
  }
  // Otherwise, it's a local path - prepend the API base URL
  const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000'
  return `${API_URL}${url}`
}
```

### Photo Upload Flow
1. User selects file from file picker
2. Frontend creates FormData with file
3. POST request to `/api/v1/tarantulas/{id}/photos`
4. Backend uploads to R2 or local storage
5. Backend creates Photo record in database
6. Backend auto-sets tarantula.photo_url if first photo
7. Response returns photo object with URLs
8. Frontend refreshes photos and tarantula data
9. UI updates automatically
