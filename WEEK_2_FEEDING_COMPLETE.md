# Week 2: Feeding Analytics & Insights ✅ COMPLETE

**Completion Date:** January 2025  
**Commits:** 33870ad, 024596f, 2b063d9

## Overview
Week 2 focused on providing comprehensive feeding insights to help users optimize their tarantula feeding schedules and track acceptance patterns.

## Features Delivered

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `apps/api/app/routers/tarantulas.py`
- **GET** `/api/v1/tarantulas/{id}/feeding-stats`
- Calculates acceptance rate (accepted / total * 100)
- Computes average days between feedings
- Tracks current acceptance streak
- Finds longest gap between feedings
- Predicts next feeding date based on historical averages
- Aggregates prey type distribution with percentages

**Schemas:** `apps/api/app/schemas/tarantula.py`
```python
class PreyTypeCount(BaseModel):
    food_type: str
    count: int
    percentage: float

class FeedingStats(BaseModel):
    tarantula_id: str
    total_feedings: int
    total_accepted: int
    total_refused: int
    acceptance_rate: float
    average_days_between_feedings: Optional[float]
    last_feeding_date: Optional[str]
    days_since_last_feeding: Optional[int]
    next_feeding_prediction: Optional[str]
    longest_gap_days: Optional[int]
    current_streak_accepted: int
    prey_type_distribution: List[PreyTypeCount]
```

### 2. Web Components
**File:** `apps/web/src/components/FeedingStatsCard.tsx`
- Color-coded status banner showing urgency
  - 🟢 Green: <7 days (well-fed)
  - 🟡 Yellow: 7-14 days (due soon)
  - 🟠 Orange: 14-21 days (overdue)
  - 🔴 Red: >21 days (critical)
- Displays "Last Fed X days ago"
- Shows predicted next feeding date
- Four metric cards:
  - Acceptance Rate (color-coded: green ≥80%, yellow ≥60%, orange <60%)
  - Average Interval (blue)
  - Current Streak (purple)
  - Longest Gap (gray)
- Prey type distribution with progress bars

**Integration:** `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/tarantulas/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added `fetchFeedingStats()` function
- State management for feeding stats
- Rendered in Overview tab sidebar

### 3. Mobile Components
**File:** `apps/mobile/src/components/FeedingStatsCard.tsx`
- React Native implementation with StyleSheet
- Same visual design as web for consistency
- Touch-friendly layout with proper spacing
- Empty state for new tarantulas

**Integration:** `apps/mobile/app/tarantula/[id].tsx`
- TypeScript interfaces matching backend
- Fetch function using apiClient
- Positioned between Molt History and Growth sections

### 4. Collection Card Badges
**Web Dashboard:** `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Replaced static "Active" badge with dynamic feeding status
- Fetches stats for all tarantulas on page load
- Shows "Fed Xd ago" with color-coded background
- Uses emoji indicators: ✓, 📅, ⏰, ⚠️

**Mobile Collection:** `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Compact badge overlaid on card image (top left)
- Format: "emoji Xd" (e.g., "✓ 3d")
- rgba backgrounds for transparency
- Same color system as web

## Technical Details

### Color System
```typescript
// Feeding Status Colors
<7 days:    Green   (#22c55e) - Well-fed
7-14 days:  Yellow  (#eab308) - Due soon
14-21 days: Orange  (#f97316) - Overdue  
>21 days:   Red     (#ef4444) - Critical

// Acceptance Rate Colors
≥80%: Green   (#10b981) - Excellent
≥60%: Yellow  (#eab308) - Good
<60%: Orange  (#f97316) - Needs attention
```

### Calculations
- **Acceptance Rate:** `(total_accepted / total_feedings) * 100`
- **Average Interval:** Sum of days between consecutive feedings / number of gaps
- **Next Feeding Prediction:** `last_feeding_date + average_interval`
- **Current Streak:** Count consecutive accepted feedings from most recent
- **Prey Distribution:** Counter aggregation with percentage calculation

## Benefits
✅ **Feeding Schedule Optimization:** Predicts when each T needs to eat  
✅ **At-a-Glance Status:** Color-coded badges show urgency instantly  
✅ **Pattern Recognition:** Acceptance rates reveal feeding preferences  
✅ **Diet Diversity:** Prey distribution shows variety (or lack thereof)  
✅ **Historical Tracking:** Longest gaps and streaks provide insights

## Testing Recommendations
- [ ] Add tarantulas with varying feeding histories
- [ ] Test edge cases: no feedings, single feeding, all refused
- [ ] Verify predictions with different intervals (e.g., weekly vs monthly)
- [ ] Check color coding at threshold boundaries (6/7 days, 13/14 days, etc.)
- [ ] Confirm prey distribution percentages sum to 100%
- [ ] Test mobile badge visibility on dark/light photos

## Next Steps
**Week 3: Collection Dashboard & Analytics** (Starting next)
- Overall collection statistics
- Growth rate comparisons across collection
- Feeding schedule calendar view
- Species-specific insights
- Export data functionality
