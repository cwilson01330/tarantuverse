2. **High Impact**: Keepers LOVE seeing their data visualized
3. **Showcases Your Data**: Makes all that feeding/molt logging pay off
4. **Great for Marketing**: Beautiful charts = great screenshots
5. **Foundation for More**: Analytics enables predictions and AI features later

### Suggested Implementation Order:
1. **Week 1: Growth Tracking**
   - Add weight/size fields to molt logs (if not there)
   - Create growth chart component
   - Add to tarantula detail page (web + mobile)

2. **Week 2: Feeding Analytics**
   - Calculate feeding statistics
   - Create feeding pattern charts
   - Add "last fed" indicators to collection cards
   - Feeding frequency analysis

3. **Week 3: Dashboard & Collection Stats**
   - Create analytics page/screen
   - Collection overview cards
   - Species distribution chart
