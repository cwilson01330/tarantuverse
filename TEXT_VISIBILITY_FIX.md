# Text Visibility Fix - Species Care Sheet Page

**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Issue**: Text values on species care sheet page appearing invisible/white
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

## Problem Description

User reported that text values on the species care sheet page were not visible. Looking at the screenshot, the labels (Temperature, Humidity, Adult, Type, Depth) were visible, but the actual data values were invisible or appearing as white text on white background.

## Root Cause

The data value `<p>` elements in the species care sheet page were missing explicit text color classes. They were relying on default styling which rendered as white or very light text against the white card backgrounds.

This is the same issue we fixed earlier in the tarantula detail page - any time we display data values, we need explicit color classes.

## Solution Applied

Added explicit `text-gray-900` (dark gray, almost black) classes to all data value elements throughout the species care sheet page.

### Sections Fixed

**1. Climate Section**
- Temperature range values
- Humidity range values

**2. Enclosure Section**
- Sling enclosure size
- Juvenile enclosure size  
- Adult enclosure size

**3. Substrate Section**
- Substrate type
- Substrate depth

**4. Additional Care Section**
- Water dish requirement
- Webbing amount
- Burrowing status
- Added `text-gray-900` to parent div for all items

**5. Feeding Schedule Section**
- Sling feeding frequency
- Juvenile feeding frequency
- Adult feeding frequency

**6. Header Basic Info**
- Native region
- Adult size
- Temperament
- Growth rate

**7. Care Guide Section**
- Long-form care guide text (changed to `text-gray-700` for better readability)

## Code Changes Example

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="mb-3">
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Temperature</p>
  <p className="text-lg">  {/* ‚ùå No color class */}
    {species.temperature_min}¬∞F - {species.temperature_max}¬∞F
  </p>
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="mb-3">
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Temperature</p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">  {/* ‚úÖ Explicit color */}
    {species.temperature_min}¬∞F - {species.temperature_max}¬∞F
  </p>
</div>
```

## Files Modified

1. `apps/web/src/app/species/[id]/page.tsx`
   - Added `text-gray-900` to 16 different text elements
   - Ensures all data values are visible

## Testing Verification

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Temperature and humidity values are visible and dark
- [ ] Enclosure sizes (sling, juvenile, adult) are visible
- [ ] Substrate type and depth are visible
- [ ] Additional care items (water dish, webbing, burrowing) are visible
- [ ] Feeding schedule frequencies are visible
- [ ] Header info (native region, adult size, etc.) is visible
- [ ] Care guide text is visible and readable

## Design Standard

**Going forward, remember:**

### Labels (descriptive text)
Use: `text-gray-600` or `text-gray-500`
- Muted color for labels
- Example: "Temperature", "Humidity", "Type"

### Data Values (actual content)
Use: `text-gray-900`
- Dark, highly visible color
- Example: "75¬∞F - 85¬∞F", "coco fiber", "3 inches"

### Body Text (paragraphs, notes)
Use: `text-gray-700` or `text-gray-900`
- Readable but not too harsh
- Example: Care guide, notes fields

### Never rely on default text color!
Always be explicit with Tailwind classes.

## Related Issues

This is part of an ongoing pattern where default text styling doesn't work properly. Similar fixes applied to:
- Tarantula detail page
- Form inputs (fixed in globals.css)
- Other data display pages
