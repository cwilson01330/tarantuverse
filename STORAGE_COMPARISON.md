```python
# Current architecture makes it easy:
# Just change environment variables!

# From R2 ‚Üí AWS S3:
R2_ACCOUNT_ID ‚Üí AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID ‚Üí AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
R2_BUCKET_NAME ‚Üí AWS_S3_BUCKET
R2_PUBLIC_URL ‚Üí S3_CLOUDFRONT_URL

# Storage service handles the rest!
