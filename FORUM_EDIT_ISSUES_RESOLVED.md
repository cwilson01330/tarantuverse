# Forum Edit/Delete Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Issues:** Web CORS error, Mobile missing edit buttons

## Issues Found

### 1. Web - CORS Preflight Failure üî¥
**Error:**
```
OPTIONS /api/v1/forums/posts/1 HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Access to fetch has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check
```

**Root Cause:**
- Browser sends OPTIONS preflight before PATCH request
- FastAPI's `HTTPBearer` security dependency was evaluating on OPTIONS requests
- OPTIONS requests don't include the Authorization header by design
- Security dependency rejected the OPTIONS request with 400 error
- Actual PATCH request never sent because preflight failed

**Solution:** ‚úÖ
Added middleware to intercept OPTIONS requests before they reach endpoint handlers:
```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def options_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    if request.method == "OPTIONS":
        return Response(
            status_code=200,
            headers={
                "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": request.headers.get("origin", "*"),
                "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS",
                "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "*",
                "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
                "Access-Control-Max-Age": "3600",
            }
        )
    return await call_next(request)
```

Also added PATCH to CORS allowed methods.

### 2. Mobile - Edit Buttons Not Showing üî¥
**Symptoms:**
- Edit/delete buttons not visible on user's own posts
- Code implementation looks correct
- Permission check using proper `post.author.id === currentUserId`

**Debug Logs:**
```
[Thread] Fetching current user, token exists: false
currentUserId: null
canEdit: null
```

**Root Cause:**
- User has never logged in on the mobile app
- No auth token stored in AsyncStorage
- `fetchCurrentUser()` returns early when no token found
- `currentUserId` remains null
- Permission check fails: `null && post.author.id === null` = false
- Edit buttons don't render

**Solution:** ‚úÖ
**User needs to log in on mobile!**

The code is working correctly:
- ‚úÖ Token check implemented
- ‚úÖ Permission check correct
- ‚úÖ Conditional rendering proper
- ‚ùå Just missing the token because user never logged in

**Steps to Fix:**
1. Open mobile app
2. Navigate to Profile tab
3. Log in with credentials
4. Token saved to AsyncStorage
5. Return to forums
6. Edit buttons will appear

**After Login, Logs Should Show:**
```
[Thread] Fetching current user, token exists: true
[Thread] Auth response status: 200
[Thread] Current user ID: 547d4b9e-bc22-4579-a8ae-8315b307b919
[Thread] Edit check: { canEdit: true, ... }
```

- `76adeaf` - "docs: Add explanation for mobile auth token issue"

## Additional Fix - View Count Improvement üéâ

**Feature:** Thread authors no longer inflate their own view counts

**Implementation:**
```python
# Only increment view count if viewer is not the thread author
if not current_user or str(current_user.id) != str(thread.author_id):
    thread.view_count += 1
    db.commit()
```

**Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Anonymous users increment view count
- ‚úÖ Authenticated non-authors increment view count  
- ‚ùå Thread authors viewing their own threads DON'T increment

**Verification:**
View count went from 20 ‚Üí 21 when anonymous mobile user viewed thread (correct!)

**Commit:** `2b7e49e` - "feat: Exclude thread authors from view count increments"
