# R2 Configuration Troubleshooting

## Issue: Still seeing "Using local filesystem storage (development mode)"

### ✅ Variables You Have Set (from screenshot):
```
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 744ed65fc86f7f602f560c61e735722d
R2_ACCOUNT_ID = 809935ae1f0e5bae17b468ef2475fc11
R2_BUCKET_NAME = tarantuverse-photos
R2_PUBLIC_URL = https://pub-739a81bdc01a40bb8cfce4a58b122d17.r2.dev
R2_SECERET_ACCESS_KEY = a7e961a4e7aa891b0171eb1622b497d61e0cdbd275cab269af77da99of59645a
```

### 🚨 FOUND THE ISSUE!

Look at the variable name in your screenshot:
```
R2_SECERET_ACCESS_KEY  ❌ (TYPO!)
```

It should be:
```
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  ✅ (Correct spelling)
```

## 🔧 Fix:

1. Go to Render → Your service → Environment
2. Find the variable named `R2_SECERET_ACCESS_KEY`
3. **Delete it**
4. Click "Add Environment Variable"
5. Add new variable:
   ```
   Key: R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   Value: a7e961a4e7aa891b0171eb1622b497d61e0cdbd275cab269af77da99of59645a
   ```
6. Click "Save Changes"
7. Wait for automatic redeployment

## ✅ After Fix

Check your Render logs and you should now see:

```
🔍 R2 Configuration Check:
  R2_ACCOUNT_ID: ✓
  R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ✓
  R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ✓
  R2_BUCKET_NAME: ✓
  R2_PUBLIC_URL: ✓
  📡 R2 Endpoint: https://809935ae1f0e5bae17b468ef2475fc11.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
✅ Using Cloudflare R2 storage: tarantuverse-photos
  🌐 Public URL: https://pub-739a81bdc01a40bb8cfce4a58b122d17.r2.dev
```

## 🎯 Verification

After the redeployment completes:
1. Upload a new photo through your app
2. The photo URL should start with: `https://pub-739a81bdc01a40bb8cfce4a58b122d17.r2.dev/`
3. Photo should load successfully

## 📝 Note

The new code I just pushed includes detailed debugging output, so you'll be able to see exactly which variables are detected as set or missing in the Render logs. This will make it much easier to spot configuration issues in the future!

**Root Cause**: Typo in environment variable name (`SECERET` instead of `SECRET`)
**Fix Time**: 2 minutes (delete + re-add variable)
**Status**: Ready to fix
